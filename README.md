# Java--BasicBankingSystem

- It's basic banking system with banking system, bank, member, banking system and controllers.
- I have tried to write code as generic as I could.
- I have tried keep coupling in the lowest level I could.
- I have divided part program into components.
- Database is not included.


## Code Parts Explanation

- Person -> Person property classes
- Member -> Person class with additional properties who is member of bank
- Bank Account -> Bank accounts properties which is stored in accountList in member (Bank account types are extended with no additional property)
- Bank -> Bank class which has it's own properties and memberList
- Banking System -> Banking System which has it's own properties and bankList
- Bank Account Controller -> It's controller class with add, delete, diplay methods for bank accounts
- Member Controller -> It's controller class with add, delete, diplay methods for members
- Bank Controller -> It's controller class with add, delete, diplay methods for bank
- Transaction Controller -> It's controller class with deposit, withdraw, transferMoney methods

- Manual Test Case -> Due to not using database in this project, I have created manual test class to check functionality


## How To Run
- Run Test Case One class in ManualTestPackage to test the code out
